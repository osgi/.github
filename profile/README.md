# OSGi Working Group

The OSGi Working Group drives the evolution and broad adoption of software technologies derived from or related to the [OSGi Specification Project](https://github.com/osgi/osgi) which is an open source initiative to create software specifications, compatible implementations and TCKs to enable development, deployment and management of embedded, server-side, and cloud-native applications by using software modularity to vastly improve the evolution, maintainability, and interoperability of applications and infrastructure.

The OSGi Working Group continues the mission of the former OSGi Alliance.
